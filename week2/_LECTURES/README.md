# D.R.Y

in coding you must apply always the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself

# continue and break

- continue = “Skip the rest of this loop iteration, and go straight to the next one.”
- break = “Stop this loop entirely we’re done here.”

# None

there is a special keyword in python called None
meaning a absence of a value
