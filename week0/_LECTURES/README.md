### ðŸ“˜ Takeaways
   
Since I already have experience with Java, Iâ€™ve realized that the concept of **side effects** in Python is quite similar to Java especially when modifying an object (like an array) inside a function.

```java
int[] arr = {0, 1, 2, 3};
modify(arr);
// inside the function: arr[0] = 99;
// result: arr = {99, 1, 2, 3}
```

same idea in python called side-effect

Another key lesson from CS50P Week 0 (as emphasized by David Malan) is the importance of writing readable code. Even if a one-liner works, it's not always the best choice if it sacrifices clarity.

```python
for instance doing print(int(input("first number : ")) + int(input("second number : ")))
```

according to him he disliked this too cause it isn't that readable there is alot to consider, good code must be readable for me and others specially

i often hear the word cryptic too haha!
